# Security Policy

Tanssi is committed to building secure infrastructure for decentralized networks. We greatly appreciate contributions from the community that help identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe youâ€™ve discovered a security issue in the Tanssi protocol, runtime, infrastructure, or supporting tools, we ask that you report it privately and responsibly.

Please **do not** file a public issue or disclose the vulnerability publicly until weâ€™ve had a chance to investigate and patch the issue.

**Contact us securely:**

- ðŸ“§ Email: [security@tanssi.foundation](mailto:security@tanssi.foundation)

When submitting a report, please include the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The impact or affected components
- Any logs, PoCs, or related materials

We will acknowledge receipt within **2 working days** and strive to keep you informed as we work toward resolution.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that security researchers adhere to the following:

- Do not intentionally harm user data or privacy
- Do not attempt to access or modify data without permission
- Avoid disrupting network operations or services
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before disclosure

By following responsible disclosure practices, you help us ensure the security and reliability of the Tanssi ecosystem.

## Discretionary Recognition and Rewards

While Tanssi does not operate a formal public bug bounty program at this time, we recognize the value of meaningful contributions to security.

**Depending on the severity and impact of the reported issue, Tanssi may offer proportional rewards or public recognition at our discretion.**

Our evaluation will consider:

- Threat level and exploitability
- Scope and affected components
- Quality and clarity of the report
- Effort involved in discovery

All such decisions are made case-by-case and at the sole discretion of the Tanssi team.
