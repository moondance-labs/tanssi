//! A staking pallet based on pools of shares.
//!
//! This pallet works with pools inspired by AMM liquidity pools to easily distribute
//! rewards with support for both non-compounding and compounding rewards.
//!
//! Each candidate internally have 3 pools:
//! - a pool for all delegators willing to auto compound.
//! - a pool for all delegators not willing to auto compound.
//! - a pool for all delegators that are in the process of removing stake.
//!
//! When delegating the funds of the delegator are reserved, and shares allow to easily
//! distribute auto compounding rewards (by simply increasing the total shared amount)
//! and easily slash (each share loose part of its value). Rewards are distributed to an account
//! id dedicated to the staking pallet, and delegators can call an extrinsic to transfer their rewards
//! to their own account (but as reserved). Keeping funds reserved in user accounts allow them to
//! participate in other processes such as gouvernance.
